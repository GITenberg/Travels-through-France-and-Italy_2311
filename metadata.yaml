description: "Travels through France and Italy is travel literature by Tobias Smollett\
  \ published in 1766.\nAfter suffering the loss of his only child, 15-year-old Elizabeth,\
  \ in April 1763, Smollett left England in June of that year. Together with his wife,\
  \ he traveled across France to Nice. In the autumn of the next year, he visited\
  \ Genoa, Rome, Florence and other towns of Italy. After staying in Nice for the\
  \ winter he returned to London by June 1765. Travels through France and Italy is\
  \ his account of this journey.\nSmollett describes in great detail the natural phenomena,\
  \ history, social life, economics, diet and morals of the places he visited. Smollett\
  \ had a lively and pertinacious curiosity, and, as his novels prove, a very quick\
  \ eye. He foresaw the merits of Cannes, then a small village, as a health-resort,\
  \ and the possibilities of the Corniche road.\nThe writing is often characterized\
  \ by spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. Smollett quarrels with innkeepers, postilions\
  \ and fellow travelers and holds many (though by no means all) foreigners he meets\
  \ in contempt. He derides the Roman Catholic faith, dueling, petty and proud nobility,\
  \ such domestic arrangements as the cicisbeo, and many other French and Italian\
  \ customs.\nLaurence Sterne, who met Smollett in Italy, satirized Smollett's jaundiced\
  \ attitude in the character of Smelfungus in A Sentimental Journey Through France\
  \ and Italy, which was written in part as an answer to Smollett's book.\n From Wikipedia\
